ClammIdea: We are building an application that pulls information on tides and weather at an indicated beach to determine if it is a good day to go clam digging
Target Audience: Clam Diggers
Problem: Our problem is that clam diggers need to look in several places to find all the information needed to determine good beach days
Goal: Our goal is to provide an easy place to see tide data and weather that is also attractive to look at 
User Stories: As a user, I am able to search for a beach and view tide and weather data for the upcoming week
Nice to Haves: Information on harmful algal booms, Social Media sharing options, User pictures
